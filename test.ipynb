    "# app.post(\"/\"): This line defines an asynchronous function named handle_request that will be triggered when a POST request is sent to the root URL (/) of your application.\n",
    "# Retrieving Request Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "# payload = await request.json(): This line retrieves the JSON data sent within the POST request and stores it in the payload variable.\n",
    "# Extracting Dialogflow Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The code then extracts specific information from the payload related to the Dialogflow request:\n",
    "# intent: The name of the Dialogflow intent that was triggered.\n",
    "# parameters: The parameters extracted from the user's query by Dialogflow.\n",
    "# output_contexts: The output contexts returned by Dialogflow.\n",
    "# session_id: This line uses a helper function (generic_helper.extract_session_id) to extract the session ID from the first output context's name.\n",
    "# Intent Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "# intent_handler_dict: This dictionary maps Dialogflow intents (keys) to corresponding Python functions (values) that handle those intents.\n",
    "# return intent_handler_dict[intent](parameters, session_id): This line retrieves the appropriate function from the dictionary based on the extracted intent and calls that function with the extracted parameters and session_id. The output of the called function is then returned as the response to the Dialogflow request.\n",
    "# Overall Functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "# This code serves as a handler for incoming Dialogflow webhook requests. It extracts the intent, parameters, and session ID from the request, and then dispatches the request to the appropriate function based on the intent using a dictionary mapping. This allows for modular handling of different Dialogflow intents within your web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The code assumes you have a helper function named generic_helper.extract_session_id that can extract the session ID from a Dialogflow output context name.\n",
    "# The code assumes you have defined the functions add_to_order, remove_from_order, complete_order, and track_order that handle the specific functionalities based on the intent and parameters.\n",
    "# Additional Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "# This code snippet focuses on the request handling logic. You'll need to integrate it within a web framework like Flask to create a complete web application.\n",
    "# Error handling and logging might be necessary for a robust implementation in a production environment."
